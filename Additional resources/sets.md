# Python Sets

In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are mutable, meaning you can add or remove elements, but the elements themselves must be immutable (e.g., numbers, strings, or tuples). This document provides an overview of Python sets, including their creation, manipulation, and common operations.

## Creating Sets

You can create a set by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of items within curly braces `{}` or by using the `set()` constructor. Note that sets automatically remove duplicate elements.

```python
# Example of creating a set
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Using the set() constructor
mixed_set = set([1, "hello", 3.14, True])

# Duplicates are automatically removed
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3}
print(unique_numbers)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}
```

## Accessing Set Elements

Since sets are unordered, you cannot access elements using indices. Instead, you can check for membership using the `in` keyword or iterate over the set using a loop.

```python
# Checking membership
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print("apple" in fruits)  # Output: True

# Iterating over a set
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

---

## Modifying Sets

Sets are mutable, so you can add or remove elements after creation.

### Adding Elements
- Use the `add()` method to add a single element.
- Use the `update()` method to add multiple elements.

```python
# Adding elements
fruits.add("orange")
fruits.update(["mango", "grape"])
print(fruits)  # Output: {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "mango", "grape"}
```

### Removing Elements
- Use the `remove()` method to remove a specific element (raises an error if the element is not found).
- Use the `discard()` method to remove a specific element (does not raise an error if the element is not found).
- Use the `pop()` method to remove and return an arbitrary element.
- Use the `clear()` method to remove all elements.

```python
# Removing elements
fruits.remove("banana")
fruits.discard("grape")
fruits.pop()
fruits.clear()
```

## Set Methods

Python provides several built-in methods for working with sets:

- `add()`: Adds a single element to the set.
- `update()`: Adds multiple elements to the set.
- `remove()`: Removes a specific element (raises an error if not found).
- `discard()`: Removes a specific element (no error if not found).
- `pop()`: Removes and returns an arbitrary element.
- `clear()`: Removes all elements from the set.
- `union()`: Returns a new set containing all elements from both sets.
- `intersection()`: Returns a new set containing common elements.
- `difference()`: Returns a new set containing elements in the first set but not in the second.
- `symmetric_difference()`: Returns a new set containing elements in either set but not both.

```python
# Example of set methods
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

print(set1.union(set2))  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(set1.intersection(set2))  # Output: {3}
print(set1.difference(set2))  # Output: {1, 2}
print(set1.symmetric_difference(set2))  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}
```

---

## Set Operations

Sets support mathematical set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. These can be performed using methods or operators.

```python
# Using operators
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

print(set1 | set2)  # Union: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(set1 & set2)  # Intersection: {3}
print(set1 - set2)  # Difference: {1, 2}
print(set1 ^ set2)  # Symmetric Difference: {1, 2, 4, 5}
```

---

## Frozen Sets

A frozen set is an immutable version of a set. It is created using the `frozenset()` constructor and cannot be modified after creation.

```python
# Example of a frozen set
frozen = frozenset([1, 2, 3])
# frozen.add(4)  # This will raise an AttributeError
```

---

## When to Use Sets

Sets are ideal for:
- Removing duplicates from a collection.
- Performing mathematical set operations (e.g., union, intersection).
- Checking for membership efficiently (faster than lists or tuples).

```python
# Example of removing duplicates
numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
unique_numbers = set(numbers)
print(unique_numbers)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}
```
