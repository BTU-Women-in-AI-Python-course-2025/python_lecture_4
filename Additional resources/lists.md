# Python Lists

In Python, a list is a versatile and widely-used data structure that can hold an ordered collection of items. Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify their contents after creation. This document provides an overview of Python lists, including their creation, manipulation, and common operations.

## Creating Lists

You can create a list by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of items within square brackets `[]`.

```python
# Example of creating a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed_list = [1, "hello", 3.14, True]
```

## Accessing List Elements

You can access elements in a list using their index. Python uses zero-based indexing, meaning the first element is at index `0`.

```python
# Accessing elements
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple
print(fruits[2])  # Output: cherry
```

Negative indexing is also supported, where `-1` refers to the last element.

```python
print(fruits[-1])  # Output: cherry
```

---

## Modifying Lists

Lists are mutable, so you can change their elements after creation.

```python
# Modifying an element
fruits[1] = "blueberry"
print(fruits)  # Output: ["apple", "blueberry", "cherry"]
```

## List Methods

Python provides several built-in methods to manipulate lists:

- `append()`: Adds an element to the end of the list.
- `insert()`: Inserts an element at a specific position.
- `remove()`: Removes the first occurrence of a value.
- `pop()`: Removes and returns the element at a given index (default is the last element).
- `sort()`: Sorts the list in ascending order.
- `reverse()`: Reverses the order of the list.
- `clear()`: Removes all elements from the list.

```python
# Example of list methods
fruits.append("orange")
fruits.insert(1, "mango")
fruits.remove("cherry")
fruits.pop(2)
fruits.sort()
fruits.reverse()
fruits.clear()
```

## List Slicing

You can extract a portion of a list using slicing. The syntax is `list[start:stop:step]`.

```python
# Example of slicing
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(numbers[2:5])  # Output: [3, 4, 5]
print(numbers[:4])   # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(numbers[::2])  # Output: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```

---

## List Comprehensions

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. They consist of an expression followed by a `for` clause.

```python
# Example of list comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
print(squares)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

---

## Common List Operations

- **Length of a list**: Use `len()` to get the number of elements.
- **Check if an item exists**: Use the `in` keyword.
- **Concatenate lists**: Use the `+` operator.
- **Repeat a list**: Use the `*` operator.

```python
# Example of common operations
print(len(fruits))  # Output: 3
print("apple" in fruits)  # Output: True
combined = fruits + numbers
repeated = fruits * 2
```
