# Python Tuples

In Python, a tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of items. Tuples are similar to lists, but unlike lists, they cannot be modified after creation. This makes tuples useful for storing data that should not change. This document provides an overview of Python tuples, including their creation, accessing elements, and common operations.

## Creating Tuples

You can create a tuple by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of items within parentheses `()`. If you have only one item, you need to include a trailing comma to distinguish it from a regular variable.

```python
# Example of creating a tuple
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
mixed_tuple = (1, "hello", 3.14, True)

# Single-element tuple
single_element_tuple = (42,)
```

## Accessing Tuple Elements

You can access elements in a tuple using their index. Like lists, Python uses zero-based indexing.

```python
# Accessing elements
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple
print(fruits[2])  # Output: cherry
```

Negative indexing is also supported, where `-1` refers to the last element.

```python
print(fruits[-1])  # Output: cherry
```

---

## Immutable Nature of Tuples

Tuples are immutable, meaning you cannot change their elements after creation. Attempting to modify a tuple will result in an error.

```python
# Trying to modify a tuple (will raise an error)
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
# fruits[1] = "blueberry"  # This will raise a TypeError
```

---

## Tuple Methods

Since tuples are immutable, they have fewer built-in methods compared to lists. The most commonly used methods are:

- `count()`: Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in the tuple.
- `index()`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value.

```python
# Example of tuple methods
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2)
print(numbers.count(2))  # Output: 3
print(numbers.index(3))  # Output: 2
```

---

## Tuple Slicing

You can extract a portion of a tuple using slicing. The syntax is `tuple[start:stop:step]`.

```python
# Example of slicing
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
print(numbers[2:5])  # Output: (3, 4, 5)
print(numbers[:4])   # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4)
print(numbers[::2])  # Output: (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
```

---

## Common Tuple Operations

- **Length of a tuple**: Use `len()` to get the number of elements.
- **Check if an item exists**: Use the `in` keyword.
- **Concatenate tuples**: Use the `+` operator.
- **Repeat a tuple**: Use the `*` operator.

```python
# Example of common operations
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(len(fruits))  # Output: 3
print("apple" in fruits)  # Output: True
combined = fruits + numbers
repeated = fruits * 2
```

---

## When to Use Tuples

Tuples are ideal for:
- Storing data that should not change (e.g., constants, configuration settings).
- Using as keys in dictionaries (since they are immutable and hashable).
- Returning multiple values from a function.

```python
# Example of returning multiple values from a function
def get_coordinates():
    return (10, 20)

x, y = get_coordinates()
print(x, y)  # Output: 10 20
```
